## Introduction

#### What is WinterM?
- WinterM is a package for Atom [![Atom Version][atom-image]][atom-url]
#### What does WinterM do?
- WinterM opens a terminal of your choice in the current directory of the file you are editing or if a file is not open it will open the terminal in the first project folder in your sidebar.
#### Why did you make this if there are built in terminals for Atom?
- Those terminals do not work on most Windows 10 systems and I was sick of having to cd into the project directory.

**Currently only tested on windows, See Todo for future plans**


## Install

```sh
$ apm install winterm
```
